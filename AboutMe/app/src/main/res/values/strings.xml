    <string name="bio"> Hi, my name is Adha.
\n\nI love Star.
\n\nThe kind star i like is blink blink at the sky.
\nFun fact is that is a star very far away from the earth.
\n\I like star because star have a pattern in the sky.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
